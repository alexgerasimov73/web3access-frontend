# Web3Access

**Web3Access** is a Web3 project showcasing user authentication, onboarding, wallet connection, and blockchain interaction on the Ethereum **Sepolia** testnet.

The app leverages **Web3Auth** for authentication, along with **MetaMask**, **Google**, **LinkedIn**, or using your email for wallet connection.
New users go through a mandatory onboarding process before accessing a personal dashboard with account details and real-time blockchain data.

## Features

- **Web3Auth Authentication**: Secure login and wallet connection via Web3Auth.
- **MetaMask Wallet**: Seamless integration with MetaMask for managing usersâ€™ web3 wallets.
- **Onboarding Process**: New users must complete an onboarding procedure before accessing the dashboard.
- **Private Dashboard**: A personalized space where users can view information about themselves after logging in.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Integration with the Ethereum Sepolia testnet for real-time data and contract interaction.

## Demo

You can open demo on [Render](https://web3access-frontend.onrender.com/).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Yarn or npm

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexgerasimov73/web3access-frontend.git
```

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the application.

## API Integration

This frontend is integrated with the backend API, which is hosted on Render and can be accessed at: [Web3Access API](https://web3access-backend.onrender.com). The backend repository is available [here](https://github.com/alexgerasimov73/web3access-backend)

## Blockchain Interaction

The application interacts with the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, allowing users to:

- View their wallet balances.
- Interact with smart contracts on the test network.

**Note:** Ensure your wallet is connected to the Sepolia testnet and has test ETH to fully utilize the blockchain features.

### Switching to Sepolia Network in MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown at the top.
2. Select Sepolia Test Network. If it's not visible:

- Go to **Settings** > **Advanced** > Enable **Show test networks**.
  If you don't have test ETH, you can request some from a [Sepolia faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia).

## Styling

The application is styled using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and leverages [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for component styling.

## Deployment

The backend is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/). The database is hosted on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Future Enhancements

- **KYC/AML Integration**: Although not implemented, the onboarding process includes information on how to handle KYC/AML with recommended tools like [Onfido](https://onfido.com/).
- **Refactoring the code base**: It needs to get rid of TODO's, optimize, and refactor code out where it's necessary.
- **Test covering**: The application will be covered with tests.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Additional contract interaction.
